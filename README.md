# Go Crud API

This is an API written in Go, built on the Gin framework.

I am experimenting with using Golang to write a REST API which interacts with a database.

## How to run

Executing `go run main.go` in terminal will start the webserver on `localhost:8080`

### Endpoints:

Sending a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8080/preferences` will return a json array of objects from the database.
